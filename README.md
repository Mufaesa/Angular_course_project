# Angular course project

This project is based on the Udemy course: Angular - The Complete Guide (2023 Edition) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.


The project is a recipe + ingredients list. Everything is built using Angular.


This is also the first real project I have built with Angular and is meant as training to gain experience in using Angular. It is my goal to become an Angular developer and this is how I want to achieve it.
