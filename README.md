# Angular course project

## The Repo
This project is based on the Udemy course: Angular - The Complete Guide (2024 Edition) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.


The project is a recipe + ingredients list. Everything is built using Angular.


This is also the first real project I have built with Angular and is meant as training to gain experience in using Angular. It is my goal to become an Angular developer and this is how I want to achieve it.

## Setup
The project started with a little bit of html in it. The basic elements have been provided by the course. All functionality however was added by me afterwards.

**Technical project details:**  
Angular version: 16.2.4  
Angular CLI version: 16.2.1  
Package Manager version: NPM 9.8.0  

**Other used packages:**

## Retrospective   

### Situation
I started working on this course somewhere in August 2023. This was when I finally decided to take the time to start learning a front-end framework. I had some experience with TypeScript and Laravel (which gave me some MVC-framework knowledge) but apart from that, everything was new for me.

### Task
I went into this course knowing that there would be a lot of new things that I would have to learn. I also went into this course wanting to learn all those things. Every time the course told me to try something on my own, I did it until I got it right. With this attitude I started going through the course, little by little.

### Action
Since I was also still working on another project, I only managed to start off with a couple of hours each week. Since November 2023 I was able to fully focus on the course in order to complete it. I was at about 30% at this point.

Very slowly I got introduced to everything Angular had to offer. Some of the bigger Angular tooling required their own smaller projects for some extra practice. These can also be found on my Github page. Building everything up from scratch, bit by bit, eventually ended up becoming a fully working project.

### Result
On January 29th, 2024, I have officially completed every section of the course. I have worked with most of what Angular has to offer and have been in contact with everything I haven't worked with yet (Animation, Schematics, Standalone components...).

The course project has been established and has a great deal of functionalities. Starting off with adding components and passing data between them and eventually adding guarded HTTP requests and dynamic component loading. The project has given me a solid first experience with Angular which I can't wait to build on.

### Reflect
The start was very slow due to time restrictions. This might have made it more challenging for me to get a grip on "how Angular works". Once things did click though, I got a good grasp of everything.

A lot of things have simply been "shown" to me which I have not yet gotten the chance to try for myself.
- CLI capabilities
- Hosting
- Working with different environments
- Unit tests
- Angular Schematics
- And more.
  
I'm confident I am able to build an Angular app but it will take time, at least for now. That is because I am also confident that my Angular skills will rise quickly once working on new apps and getting the chance to put my newfound skills into practice.
